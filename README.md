# Metaverse Makers Mastermind (M3) Charter

## Who we are

> We are a group of makers working to build a practical "Metaverse" into existence.
> We are doing this through open products, content production, education, and fundraising.

Let's break that down.

## What is a Metaverse?

A metaverse is a three-dimensional world, existing in computers, created by many different people with many conflicting goals, who nonetheless loosely agree on interoperable evolving standards.

> So it's the Matrix?

Maybe "The Matrix" is an inspiration, but we're not trying to recreate reality.

> So it's the web?

The web has a lot of the right properties, but it isn't a "three-dimensional world". Technology like WebXR might help. We embrace any technology that can help, as long as it is based on interoperable evolving standards.

> So it's VR? AR? 2D?

A three-dimentsional world can be viewed through many lenses. It can be on a flat screen, attached to real locations, or completely virtual. Interoperability means these should all talk to each other.

> So it's Facebook Horizon/Steam/Oculus/Magic Leap?

These projects are run by a single business that sets the goal and dictates the standards. We can't work in a vacuum, so we try to fit our ideas with theirs.

> So it's VRChat/Minecraft/Decentraland/CryptoVoxels?

These projects are amazing, but not sufficiently interoperable, and also generally led by a single organization.

## What is a "maker"

A maker is someone who contributes towards fulfilling the goal. Making takes many shapes, such as ideation, organization, data research, design, execution, funding and other endeavors that advance our mission.

A maker is _not_ in the group for entertainment, appreciation, or keeping "up to date".

If you are not a maker you may still enjoy the things we produce, and you can still support our mission in other ways.

## What is "practical"

Practical means we are forward-thinking pragmatists. Our work cannot exist in a vacuum.

Here are some things we do _not_ believe:

- We are right and everyone else is wrong
- Everything should be "open source"
- If we make great things, people will come help
- Results emerge organically, by something other than our work
- We appreciate volunteers who work for free
- People and organizations are benevolent
- If we wait, it will happen

Here are some things we _do_ believe:

- Bias towards action and tentative answers rather than perpetual questions and talk
- Clarity of thought is important
- Our ideas compete with giants who want different things
- Money is needed for us to survive
- Everyone wants something different, but we can take aim together
- Promotion of our ideas is important work
- Time is of the essence, because others aren't waiting

## Our activities

- Regular meetings to discuss and present our ideas, and be held to accountable progress on them.
- Research events that serve as both learning and promotion of our ideas.
- Producing clear communications of our ideas, in the form of videos, blog posts, social media activity, and so on.
- Fundraising work, including Github Sponsors/Patreon/Venture Capital, where having capital available helps the group's goals.
- Organization and coordination of presentations with other leaders who do not necessarily share our views.
- Managing minutae, such as the Github organization, Discord channels, video transcriptions, etc.

## How you can help

- Participate in our meetings by presenting your idea and what you've learned.
- Work on a project that is missing, or missing in the right shape, in the open metaverse community.
